# Flior

This is a repository for the Flior Project. Flior is an event management platform where Stevens students can log in, create and view events
around them. It's a one stop solution for anything that is happening on the campus!

Core Features: 
>Event Creation: Users can create an event by providing event title, description and an image. Once an event is created, it will be visible to everyone that visits the website
